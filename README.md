# GIF Screen Recorder
[Simple GIF](https://simplegif.com) screen recorder website that provides simple video editing as well

## Why this exists
At my software internship, I was documenting my system and found GIFs are very useful (a picture is worth a thousand words);
however, there were no options for me on my laptop to record the screen to GIF. I looked online for solutions, but they all were
annoying to use (lack of features, sign up, watermarks, etc.). I wanted a tool that was extremely simple that I could instantly
start using. That's why I made this website. The goal was for this tool to be very intuitive for developers that need GIFs for
their documentation. This is a one stop shop to record your GIFs and do quick video edits. See the website at [simplegif](https://simplegif.com)

## Features
1. Rendering to GIF
2. Cropping
3. Trimming
4. Copying to Base64 String

## To Do

#### Fix Video Resolution
Known bug where cropping dimensions can cause resolution scale to error out; for now I disabled resolution customization until this is addressed.
